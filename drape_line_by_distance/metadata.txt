name=Drape Line Tools
about=This plugin extracts exact portions of an existing line by specifying start and end distances along its length. It supports Manual Mode to interactively extract a single segment from a selected feature and CSV Mode to batch-generate multiple segments from one or more line layers using a CSV file. All original attributes are retained, with a calculated segment length added to the output, and it supports overlapping and multi-segment extractions without altering the source geometry.
description=Extracts defined sub-segments of line features using start and end distances, with options for manual or CSV-based batch processing, while preserving source attributes and geometry.
